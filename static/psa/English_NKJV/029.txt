I will extol You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up, And have not let my foes rejoice over me.
O LORD my God, I cried out to You, And You healed me.
O LORD, You brought my soul up from the grave; You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Sing praise to the LORD, you saints of His, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.
For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for life; Weeping may endure for a night, But joy comes in the morning.
Now in my prosperity I said, «I shall never be moved.»
LORD, by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong; You hid Your face, and I was troubled.
I cried out to You, O LORD; And to the LORD I made supplication:
«What profit is there in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy on me; LORD, be my helper!»
You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,
To the end that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to You forever.
