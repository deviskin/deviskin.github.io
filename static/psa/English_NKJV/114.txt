I love the LORD, because He has heard My voice and my supplications.
Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live.
The pains of death surrounded me, And the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of the LORD: «O LORD, I implore You, deliver my soul!»
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; Yes, our God is merciful.
The LORD preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return to your rest, O my soul, For the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, And my feet from falling.
I will walk before the LORD In the land of the living.
