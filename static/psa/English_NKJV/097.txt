Oh, sing to the LORD a new song! For He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have gained Him the victory.
The LORD has made known His salvation; His righteousness He has revealed in the sight of the nations.
He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth; Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.
Sing to the LORD with the harp, With the harp and the sound of a psalm,
With trumpets and the sound of a horn; Shout joyfully before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar, and all its fullness, The world and those who dwell in it;
Let the rivers clap their hands; Let the hills be joyful together before the LORD,
For He is coming to judge the earth. With righteousness He shall judge the world, And the peoples with equity.
