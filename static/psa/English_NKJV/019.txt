May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob defend you;
May He send you help from the sanctuary, And strengthen you out of Zion;
May He remember all your offerings, And accept your burnt sacrifice.Selah
May He grant you according to your heartÃÅs desire, And fulfill all your purpose.
We will rejoice in your salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners! May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stand upright.
Save, LORD! May the King answer us when we call.
