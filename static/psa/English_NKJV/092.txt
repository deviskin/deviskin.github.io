The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved.
Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.
The LORD on high is mightier Than the noise of many waters, Than the mighty waves of the sea.
Your testimonies are very sure; Holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, forever.
