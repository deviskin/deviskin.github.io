I believed, therefore I spoke, «I am greatly afflicted.»
I said in my haste, «All men are liars.»
What shall I render to the LORD For all His benefits toward me?
I will take up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD Now in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His saints.
O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD Now in the presence of all His people,
In the courts of the LORD́s house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
