Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children within you.
He makes peace in your borders, And fills you with the finest wheat.
He sends out His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly.
He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;
He casts out His hail like morsels; Who can stand before His cold?
He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
He has not dealt thus with any nation; And as for His judgments, they have not known them. Praise the LORD!
