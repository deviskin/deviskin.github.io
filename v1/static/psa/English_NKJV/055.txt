Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; Fighting all day he oppresses me.
My enemies would hound me all day, For there are many who fight against me, O Most High.
Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.
In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?
All day they twist my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
They gather together, They hide, they mark my steps, When they lie in wait for my life.
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God!
You number my wanderings; Put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?
When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back; This I know, because God is for me.
In God (I will praise His word), In the LORD (I will praise His word),
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
Vows made to You are binding upon me, O God; I will render praises to You,
For You have delivered my soul from death. Have You not kept my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?
